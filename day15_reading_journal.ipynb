    "1. A comparison sort sorts a list (or something like it) by comparing members of the list to each other using a single comparator (e.g. less than or equal to, greater than or equal to). The best worst-case growth is O(_n_log_n_), and the best worst-case growth for any sorting algorithm (non-comparison included) is O(n) (or is it O(n*(k/s+d))? I can't tell if that's a coefficient that should just be ignored or something that should be left in).\n",
    "2. Bubble sort is O(n^2), which means that it gets exponentially slower as the dataset size increases. When there are algorithms that have linear O(n) performance, those are (usually) preferable.\n",
    "3. Radix sort has a growth order of O(n) (I think, as I can't seem to find the same answer listed everywhere).\n",
    "4. A sorting algorithm is stable if, when two equally valued items are in the input list, they are still in the same order relative to each other after the sort. I could see this as being useful because it makes the algorithm predictable (which is especially handy when doing unit tests).\n",
    "5. Bogosort is listed on Wikipedia as having a worst-case scenario of takeing forever (literally).\n",
    "6. The _qsort_ function in C can be implemented using any sort algorithm that the library implementer chooses, so stability is dependent on the chosen algorithm. Python's built-in _sort_ and _sorted_ functions use the Timesort algorithm, which is stable.\n",
    "7. I couldn't find the answer to this one."
